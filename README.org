* Introduction

  qmailcheck is a simple application that lets you watch multiple
  IMAP mailboxes for new mail.

* Alerts
  Each folder can be set up with different notification types when new
  mail arrives.  Alter forms include:

  - A notification (eg, a taskbar pop-up)
  - Pop the window forward
  - Flash the LED (Maemo/N900)
  - Vibrate the device (Maemo/N900)

* The TODO list
*** TODO allow for multiple mail sources (multiple IMAP boxes)
*** TODO create icons for the alert types
*** TODO restructure the mail folders preference for smaller windows
