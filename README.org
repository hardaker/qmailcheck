* Introduction

  qmailcheck is a simple application that lets you watch multiple
  IMAP mailboxes for new mail.  This is similar nature to the older
  "biff" style mail notifications, but is designed specifically to
  watch multiple IMAP folders and be extremely portable to multiple
  device types (eg, cell phones like the N900).

* Alerts
  Each folder can be set up with different notification types when new
  mail arrives.  Alter forms include:

  - A notification (eg, a taskbar pop-up)
  - Pop the window forward
  - Flash the LED (Maemo/N900)
  - Vibrate the device (Maemo/N900)

* The TODO list
*** TODO allow for multiple mail sources (multiple IMAP boxes)
*** TODO create icons for the alert types
*** TODO restructure the mail folders preference for smaller windows
